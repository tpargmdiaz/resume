        <p>I provide infrastructure support for cloud-native applications using Kubernetes and Docker in AWS environments. My responsibilities include maintaining CI/CD pipelines, improving deployment automation with GitLab and Terraform, and managing infrastructure as code with Packer and Ansible. I collaborate closely with development teams to ensure infrastructure aligns with software delivery goals and business requirements. I monitor system performance with Datadog, setting up custom dashboards and alerting systems to detect anomalies in real-time. I also handle log centralization and indexing using Elasticsearch, which allows for rapid troubleshooting and system audits. I troubleshoot production issues, implement fixes, and document post-mortem analyses to avoid recurrence. My daily work is driven by agile methodologies, ensuring short feedback cycles and continuous improvement. Additionally, I participate in architecture discussions, contribute to DevOps documentation, and mentor junior engineers. I am actively involved in cloud cost optimization and support secure networking practices through IAM policies and VPC design. My contributions help ensure system stability, developer velocity, and customer satisfaction.</p>

        <p>I was responsible for the end-to-end operation of infrastructure and L3 support for core systems. I maintained and evolved Kubernetes clusters and designed automated workflows using Terraform and GitHub Actions. I built and managed Docker images, optimized container performance, and created monitoring pipelines with Datadog to measure uptime and latency. I implemented Elasticsearch clusters for log indexing, enabling full-text search and alerting capabilities. I collaborated with developers and support engineers to resolve incidents, conduct root cause analysis, and reduce MTTR. I contributed to strategic roadmap planning and implemented cost-saving initiatives in AWS. I enforced security policies, automated compliance checks, and managed user access via SSO integrations with Google Workspace. Documentation and knowledge-sharing were central to my role, as I wrote detailed internal guides and participated in training new hires. My work improved infrastructure resilience and enabled faster deployments. I also took part in regular reviews to align DevOps practices with evolving company objectives.</p>
